# IntegralCalculusProject
App for solving integrals through aproximations

Entering your function is the first step to use the program, 
first let's define the operands of the app:

> + : Defines a binary sum between operands
> - : Defines a binary subtraction between operands
> * : Defines a binary multiplication between operands
> / : Defines a binary division between operands
> ** : Defines a binary pow between operands in form a ** b (example = x**2)

Examples of how to enter your function:

-> 2 ** x (same as 2^x)
-> x**2 + 2*x + 4  (same as x^2 + 2x + 4)
-> 2 (same as 2)
-> -x**4 - 2*x (same as -x^2 - 2x)
-> etc

NOTE:

Logarithm, Trigonometric and Exponentials are not currently
available in this version, soon will be implemented! ;)
